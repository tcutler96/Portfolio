# Portfolio
This is a simple portfolio site ([https://tcutler96.github.io/Portfolio/](https://tcutler96.github.io/Portfolio/)) built to show my skills, experience, and the work I’ve done across different areas of programming.. The site includes a full copy of my CV as well as a set of personal projects covering a variety of topics, including data analysis, software automation, game development, and image manipulation. Each project has its own page with a description and a link to its respective GitHub repository.

## Tech Used
- Python for the backend structure
- Flask to build and organise the web app
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend
- Flask Frozen to generate a static version of the site
- GitHub Pages for hosting and deployment
