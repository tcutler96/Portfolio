# Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio site built using Python to present myself and my work in a clear and straightforward manner. The site includes a full copy of my CV as well as a set of personal projects covering a variety of topics, including data analysis, software automation, game development, and image manipulation. Each project has its own tab with a description and a link to its GitHub repository.

## Tech Used

* Python for the backend structure.
* Flask to build and organise the web app.
* Flask Frozen to generate a static version of the site.
* GitHub Pages for hosting and deployment.
